  <h1>How to play:</h1>
  <h2>“Traditional” Assassin (pre alpha)</h2>
  In Assassin, every player in the game is assigned a target. you will have access to their profile picture and a scanner. Targets cannot see the distance their assassin. <br/>
  The scanner reveals your distance from your target and is activateable for 5 seconds at a time. After activation, it goes through a cooldown time* before being able to use it again.<br/>
  when creating a game of Assassin, safe zones will be marked on the play area by the game admin. These areas are visible to everyone in the game. You cannot be killed within a safezone, and your location is not trackable within the safezone.
  safezones can be disabled when creating the game.<br/><br/>
  To assassinate someone, you have to be within a certain distance of your target*. Once you are close enough, you will be able to press a button on your phone to assassinate your target. When the button is pressed, the target will have their own button show up on their phone to escape. If the target does not press that button within the specified time limit*, they are assassinated and are out of the game. If the button is pressed in time, the assassin will not be able to use the scanner or kill their target for some time, giving the target a chance to run away.
  (the escape button can be disabled when creating the game)<br/><br/>

  In Assassin Go, every player is assigned a target. You will have access to their profile picture and a scanner. Targets cannot see their assassin.
  The scanner reveals your distance from your target and is activateable for 5 seconds at a time. After activation, it goes through a two minute cooldown time before being able to use it again.<br/>
  if your target is not active or is too hard to catch, you can re-search for a different target that is in the same area as you.
  Active zones will be designated to everyone on the map. You are only able to play Assassin Go within these areas.

When the button is pressed, the target will have their own button show up on their phone to escape. If the target does not press that button within 1 second, they are assassinated and are out of the game. If the button is pressed in time, the assassin will not be able to use the scanner or kill their target for some time, giving the target a chance to run away.
