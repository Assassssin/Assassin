Come along, my children

Come and sing with me

Telling time is easy, count it

One

Two

Three

Come along, my children

Come and learn with me

Tick

Tock

Toooock

Telling time is easy

This is what we say

Each clock has a special face, so

Come and look their way

Hour, hand, and minute

Finely carved from wood - they’d

Crush you right between the middle

If they only could

Hey everybody - let’s look at the clock

Ticking off the minutes till the hour’s struck

Count the precious seconds, running out of luck

Tick

Tock

Tick

Tock

Tick

Tock

Toooock

Telling time is easy

This is what they say

Look at every passing second

Till they’ve passed away

No one can avoid it

Time will come for you

Best to make your peace, because there’s

Nothing you can do

Time is running out

And I’m prob’ly trapped in

Time - still running out

Yet I’m feeling nothin’

Time is running out

And I’m prob’ly trapped in

Time - still running out

Yet I’m feeling nothin’

Time is all we’ve got

But we don’t have much and

Time will soon run out

Yet I’m feeling nothin’

Time is all we’ve got

But we don’t have much and

Time will soon run out

Oh yeah!

Hey everybody - let’s look at the clock

Ticking off the minutes till the hour's struck

Count the precious seconds, running out of luck

Tick

Tock

Tick

Tock

Tick

Tock

Toooock

Look out everybody - oh here comes the clock

Stomping through the hallway now the hour's struck

Time's got us running but we're really stuck

Tick

Tock

Tick

Tock

Tick

Tock

Toooock

Now

You’ve

Learned

With

Me
